# SFDX_NestedJsonParser

## This project contains utility class responsible for parsing service response with NESTED Json payload to apex objects

###### Important Note: This only contains my version of solution but may not be the most efficient one; and might still be subject for refactoring. 

*******************************************************************************************************

These utility classes enable you to parse a nested JSON-formatted response that's returned from a call to an external service, such as a web service callout using two appraoches:
  - using Json Methods only </br>
  - and a Wrapper Class
